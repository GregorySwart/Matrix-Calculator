# Matrix-Calculator

Trying to improve my python skills by making a basic matrix calculator. I treat matrices as lists of lists, and execute operations on them by redefining each cell by using nested loops.

At the moment, the calculator can find the determinant of any square matrix, add any matrices of the same dimensions, and multiply any two matrices with compatible dimensions.

My plan at the moment is to add an eigenvalue finder option, and eventually, a function that finds eigenvectors and eigenspaces too.
