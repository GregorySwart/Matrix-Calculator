# Matrix-Calculator

Trying to improve my python skills by making a basic matrix calculator. For now it's just a lot of loops, but I will try and implement some more elegant solutions if I can find any.

At the moment, the calculator can find the determinant of any 2-by-2 or 3-by-3 square matrix, add any matrices of the same dimensions, and multiply any two matrices with compatible dimensions.

My plan at the moment is to generalise the determinant-finder function and building on this also add an eigenvalue finder option, and eventually, a function that finds eigenvectors and eigenspaces too.
